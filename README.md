AI in the Media!
Patrick Hourihan

Overview:

After watching the superbowl this year, I had a few takeaways. First, as
a Patriots fan, this is going to be a sad offseason. Second, the
commercials featured a lot of AI content. These initial impressions of
the superbowl commercials ignited a deeper curiosity, which is the
motivation for my project. This project analyzes recent
technology-related news articles to understand how often tech related
news has the words “AI”.

Using data collected from the source NewsAPI, this project uses a small
data pipeline that retrieves article data, cleans, and visualizes it for
the audience. The contents produced contain AI usage in recent
publications online.

Problem Framing: This project focuses on three main areas: How
frequently is technology news published over the past few weeks? How
often does the words artificial intelligence appear in technology news
headlines Which news sources produce the most

Data Preparation:

Collected from NewsAPI, which returns news article information in a raw
JSON. Only the fields needed for the analysis were kept. Each article
was reduced to its source, title, publication time, and author. I wanted
to keep the dataset relevant to my project prompt. Next, the publication
time was cleaned by converting it from a text string into a data and
time format. By doing this, I could group articles by day or month and
compare how often technology news was published over time. Finally,
article tiles were examined for the “AI”.

Visualizations: 1 Three Visualizations using matplotlib:

Technology News Published Over Time (2026) A line chart shows the
article counts aggregate by month to highlight overall publication
trends of AI. Since the Super Bowl in early February, there is a
noticeable increase in AI Articles being produced.

2 Top Sources Publishing AI Articles

I was surprised with my findings in this visual because there were a lot
of sources that I had not heard of before. Some of the more prominent
names such as Yahoo Entertainment, had significantly less postings than
Wired and Gimzodo.com.

3 AI Mentions vs Non-AI headlines

This was the most interesting result because the visual showed major
differences in favor of AI related headlines. This visual only
encompasses articles published in 2026.

Conclusion:

This analysis encompasses notable media and news outlets in 2026. My
project shows that technology news is published frequently, contributing
to the trend that technology remains a vocal point in modern media. This
project concludes the main focus of this technology oriented news is
artificial intelligence. While AI does not dominate all technology
reporting, its frequent appearance in artificial titles indicate the
direction is trending upward, as it is increasingly being mentioned.

Overall, the findings indicate that API-based data proves that there is
a steady increase in AI-oriented media articles since the Superbowl.
Based on the analysis, this trend looks like it will continue.
